To check if program (parent) is completed upon completion of module (child)


total count of modules in current program:

SELECT COUNT * FROM modules
WHERE modules.program_id = current_program_id


count of current dogâ€™s completed modules in current program:

SELECT COUNT * FROM progress
WHERE progress.dog_id = current_dog_id
  AND parent_id = current_program_id
  AND entity_type = 'module'
  AND status = 'completed'

if both are equal, completed = True







unique id's across all training entities:

CREATE SEQUENCE entity_id_seq;
CREATE TABLE programs (id INT DEFAULT nextval('entity_id_seq') NOT NULL, title VARCHAR ...);
CREATE TABLE modules (id INT DEFAULT nextval('entity_id_seq') NOT NULL, title ...);
